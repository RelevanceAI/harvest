# Harvest

> Background coding agent service that tends to your repositories like farmers tending to crops - autonomous development while you sleep

<!-- MAINTENANCE: When adding new docs, update this index -->

## Quick Start

- [README](README.md): Project overview, architecture, capabilities, getting started
- [Claude Code Configuration](.claude/claude.md): AI agent rules and workflows

## AI Agent Configuration

- [Autonomous Agent Rules](docs/ai/autonomous-agent.md): Rules for autonomous/background agent operation
- [Local Development Rules](docs/ai/local-development.md): Rules for local human-assisted development

## Core AI Rules (All Contexts)

- [Git Workflow](docs/ai/shared/git-workflow.md): Safe-Carry-Forward sync, snapshots, checkpoints, squashing
- [Code Comments](docs/ai/shared/code-comments.md): Explain WHY not WHAT; preserve existing comments
- [Planning Guidelines](docs/ai/shared/planning.md): Research before coding, use Gemini for adversarial review, hierarchical planning
- [Problem-Solving](docs/ai/shared/problem-solving.md): Find proper solutions, avoid hacks, check official APIs first
- [Documentation Standards](docs/ai/shared/documentation.md): Update docs with changes, capture gotchas, avoid stale values
- [Complexity Heuristic](docs/ai/shared/complexity-heuristic.md): Decide when to invoke brainstorming based on task complexity
- [Verification](docs/ai/shared/verification.md): Smart verification (tests for logic, appropriate checks for non-logic)
- [Debugging](docs/ai/shared/debugging.md): Systematic debugging with failure escalation (fail-forward → systematic → panic)
- [Finishing Workflow](docs/ai/shared/finishing-workflow.md): 4-option completion framework with test verification gate
- [Pull Request Guidelines](docs/ai/shared/pull-requests.md): PR conventions and review standards
- [Linear Issues](docs/ai/shared/linear-issues.md): Clean, scannable issues; when to create vs update; AI attribution
